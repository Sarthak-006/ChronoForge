3. Player context assembled (level, inventory, history)
4. AI prompt constructed with current game state
5. Safe completion handler processes request
6. Primary model generates quest or falls back to secondary
7. Response validated and parsed
8. Quest data stored in session state
9. UI updated with new quest information
10. Event logged for analytics

### Player Interaction Flow
1. User submits quest solution
2. Solution validated and formatted
3. Evaluation prompt constructed with quest context
4. AI evaluates creativity and correctness
5. Rewards calculated including bonuses
6. Player progression updated (XP, shards, items)
7. Achievement system checked for unlocks
8. Analytics data recorded
9. Success feedback displayed to user
10. Next quest opportunity presented

### Image Generation Flow
1. Quest or character image requested
2. Context-aware prompt generation
3. Pollinations AI API called with optimized parameters
4. Image URL returned and validated
5. Image displayed in UI with fallback handling
6. Caching for performance optimization
